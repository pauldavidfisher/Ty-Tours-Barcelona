# Pinotxo Bar - Stall 466-470la Bouqueria Market

### tytoursbarcelona

Two days ago a Barcelona legend passed away. His name was Juan "Juanito" Bayen. 

The owner and operator of the renowned Pinotxo Bar at La Boqueria in Barcelona, his career spanned over 8 decades and his charming personality brought the place to life. I had the pleasure of meeting him last summer, when I brought my tour guests to his bar, where he smiled and posed for their many cellphone pictures. Despite his old age, he worked tirelessly and proudly held onto his title as the unofficial mascot of Barcelona. 

During his countless interviews, he would often remark that he never dreamt of retiring, and that La Boqueria was the best place in the world. A man so dedicated to his craft is so inspiring to see, and gives us a glimpse into the real heart and soul of Barcelona. 

We'll miss you Jaunito. Rest in peace üôè
